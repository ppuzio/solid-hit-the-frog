## Usage

I'm using `yarn` to manage dependencies, but feel free to use any manager that you wish.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev` or `yarn start` (`npm dev` or `npm start` for npm users)

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. Currently no backend is connected yet - so all mechanisms are browser side. Backend implementation is in progress.<br>

### `yarn build` (or `npm run build` for npm users)

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
